# What is Semantic search in AI ? 

    Semantic search in AI is a search technique that goes beyond simple keyword matching - 
    it ties to understand the meaning and intent behind your query so it can return results 
    that are contextually relevant, much like how a human would interpret a question.
    
# Core Idea

    Traditional Search : Matches exact words in your query to words in documents
    Semantic Search : interprets the context, relationship between words, and your 
    intent to find the most relevant information, even if the exact word don't match.
    
# How it works ?

    NLP - breaks down your query in to concepts, entities and relationships rather than just words
    Intent Detection - Figures out what you really mean 
    Knowledge Graphs - Uses databases of entities and their relationships to understand context 
    (e.g knowing "Paris" could mean city in France or a person's name)
    Machine Learning Models - Learn from patterns in data to improve relevance over time
    Context Awareness - Considers Factors like your location, device, and search history to tailor results
    
# Why its Powerful ?

    Better Accuracy - Finds relevant results even if you phrase your query differently
    Personalization - Adapts to your preferences and past behavior.
    Conversational queries - handles natural human-like questions instead of forcing you to 
    think like a search engine.
    Business Impact - Helps improve customer support , product discovery, and content recommendation 
    
Example: If you search for “movies where AI turns evil”, a keyword search might only find 
pages with that exact phrase. A semantic search engine would also return results for 
“films about rogue artificial intelligence” or “sci-fi thrillers with sentient robots” — because 
it understands the meaning, not just the words.
